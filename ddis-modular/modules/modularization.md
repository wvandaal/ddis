# Module: Modularization Protocol

The modularization protocol itself — how to decompose a DDIS spec that exceeds the LLM context window into manifest-driven modules with formal completeness guarantees.

**Invariants this module maintains (INV-018 compliance):**
- INV-011: An LLM receiving a properly assembled bundle can implement the module's subsystem without information from any other module
- INV-012: Modules reference each other only through constitutional elements, never direct internal references
- INV-013: Every application invariant is maintained by exactly one module
- INV-014: Every assembled bundle fits within the hard ceiling defined in the manifest's context budget
- INV-015: Every invariant declaration in the system constitution is a faithful summary of its full definition
- INV-016: The manifest accurately reflects the current state of all spec files

**Key invariants referenced from other modules (INV-018 compliance):**
- INV-001: Every implementation section traces to at least one ADR or invariant (maintained by core-standard)
- INV-006: The specification contains a cross-reference web where no section is an island (maintained by core-standard)
- INV-008: The specification is self-contained (maintained by core-standard)
- INV-017: Every implementation chapter includes explicit "DO NOT" constraints (maintained by core-standard)
- INV-018: Every implementation chapter restates the invariants it must preserve (maintained by core-standard)

## 0.13 Modularization Protocol [Conditional]

REQUIRED when the monolithic spec exceeds 4,000 lines or when the target context window cannot hold the full spec plus reasoning budget. OPTIONAL but recommended for 2,500-4,000 line specs.

> Namespace note: INV-001 through INV-019 and ADR-001 through ADR-010 are DDIS meta-standard invariants/ADRs (defined in this standard). Application specs using DDIS define their OWN invariant namespace (e.g., APP-INV-001) — never reuse the meta-standard's INV-NNN space. Examples in this section use APP-INV-NNN to demonstrate this convention.

### 0.13.1 The Scaling Problem

When the spec exceeds the LLM's context window, two failure modes emerge:

1. **Truncation**: The LLM silently drops content from the beginning, losing invariants and the formal model.

2. **Naive splitting**: Arbitrary splits break cross-references, orphan invariants, and force guessing at contracts in unseen sections.

The modularization protocol prevents both with principled decomposition and formal completeness guarantees. (Motivated by INV-008, INV-014.)

### 0.13.2 Core Concepts

**Monolith**: A DDIS spec that exists as a single document. All specs start as monoliths. Most small-to-medium specs remain monoliths.

**Module**: A self-contained unit of the spec covering one major subsystem. Each module corresponds to one chapter of PART II in the monolithic structure. A module is never read alone — it is always assembled into a bundle with the appropriate constitutional context.

**Constitution**: The cross-cutting material that constrains all modules. Contains the formal model, invariants, ADRs, quality gates, architecture overview, glossary, and performance budgets. Organized in tiers to manage its own size.

**Domain**: An architectural grouping of related modules that share tighter coupling with each other than with modules in other domains. Domains correspond to rings, layers, or crate groups in the architecture overview.

**Bundle**: The assembled document sent to an LLM for implementation. Always contains: system constitution + domain constitution + cross-domain deep context + the module itself. A bundle is the unit of LLM consumption.

**Manifest**: A machine-readable YAML file that declares all modules, their domain membership, invariant ownership, cross-module interfaces, and assembly rules. The manifest is the single source of truth for the assembly script.

(All terms defined in Glossary, Appendix A.)

### 0.13.3 The Tiered Constitution

The constitution is organized in three tiers to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck itself. Each tier has a hard line budget, a clear scope, and NO overlapping content between tiers. (Locked by ADR-006.)

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIER 1: System Constitution (200-400 lines, always)          |
|  - Design goal, core promise, non-negotiables, non-goals     |
|  - Architecture overview + domain/module manifest summary     |
|  - ALL invariants as DECLARATIONS (ID + 1-line + owner)      |
|  - ALL ADR decisions as DECLARATIONS (ID + 1-line + choice)  |
|  - Glossary (terms + 1-line definitions)                     |
|  - Quality gates (summaries only)                            |
|  - Context budget table                                      |
|  SCOPE: System-wide orientation. Knows WHAT exists, not HOW. |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIER 2: Domain Constitution (200-500 lines, per-domain)      |
|  - Domain formal model (subset of full system model)         |
|  - FULL DEFINITIONS for invariants owned by this domain      |
|  - FULL ANALYSIS for ADRs decided within this domain         |
|  - Cross-domain interface contracts (this domain's surface)  |
|  - Domain-level performance budgets                          |
|  SCOPE: Everything needed to work in this domain.            |
|  NOTE: Content here is NOT duplicated in Tier 3.             |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIER 3: Cross-Domain Deep Context (0-600 lines, per-module)   |
|  - Full definitions for OTHER-domain invariants this module   |
|    INTERFACES with (not in this module's Tier 2)              |
|  - Full ADR specs from OTHER domains that affect this module  |
|  - Interface contracts with adjacent modules in OTHER domains |
|  - Shared types defined in OTHER domains used by this module  |
|  SCOPE: Cross-domain context ONLY. Zero overlap with Tier 2. |
|  NOTE: If module has no cross-domain interfaces, Tier 3 is    |
|  EMPTY. This is common and correct.                          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| MODULE (800-3,000 lines)                                      |
|  - Module header (ownership, interfaces, negative specs)      |
|  - Full PART II content for this subsystem                   |
|  - All implementation detail for one major subsystem         |
|  SCOPE: What to build for this subsystem.                    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Assembled bundle: Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 + Module
Target budget:    1,200 - 4,500 lines per bundle
Hard ceiling:     5,000 lines (must fit in context with reasoning room)
```

// WHY THREE TIERS? Two tiers work for < 20 invariants / < 10 ADRs. Beyond that, the root exceeds budget. Three tiers add domain grouping — already present in well-architected systems. The domain boundary serves double duty: architectural isolation and context management. See ADR-006.

### 0.13.4 Invariant Declarations vs. Definitions

An invariant has two representations:

**Declaration** (Tier 1, always present, ~1 line):
```
APP-INV-017: Event log is append-only -- Owner: EventStore -- Domain: Storage
```

**Definition** (Tier 2, in the owning domain's constitution, ~10-20 lines):
```
**APP-INV-017: Event Log Append-Only**

*Events, once written, are never modified or deleted.*

  forall event in EventLog, forall t1 < t2:
    event in EventLog(t1) -> event in EventLog(t2) and event(t1) = event(t2)

Violation scenario: A compaction routine rewrites old events to save space,
silently changing event payloads. Replay produces different state.

Validation: Write 1000 events, snapshot the log, run any operation, compare
log prefix byte-for-byte.

// WHY THIS MATTERS: Append-only is the foundation of deterministic replay.
// Without it, APP-INV-003 (replay determinism) is impossible.
```

**Inclusion rules — which tier provides which level of detail:**

| Module's relationship to invariant     | Tier 1      | Tier 2 (own domain)              | Tier 3 (cross-domain)  |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Module MAINTAINS this invariant        | Declaration | Full definition (already present) | -- (same domain rule)  |
| INTERFACES, invariant in SAME domain  | Declaration | Full definition (already present) | --                     |
| INTERFACES, invariant in OTHER domain | Declaration | --                               | Full definition        |
| No relationship                       | Declaration | --                               | --                     |

Key insight: a module's maintained invariants are ALWAYS in its own domain (enforced by CHECK-4). Therefore Tier 2 always covers them; Tier 3 ONLY adds cross-domain content, eliminating duplication. The same pattern applies to ADRs.

### 0.13.5 Module Header (Required per Module)

Every module begins with a structured header that makes the module self-describing. The header uses application-level invariant identifiers (APP-INV-NNN), not the DDIS meta-standard's INV-NNN identifiers:

```yaml
# Module Header: [Module Name]
# Domain: [Domain Name]
# Maintains: APP-INV-017, APP-INV-018, APP-INV-019
# Interfaces: APP-INV-003 (via EventStore), APP-INV-032 (via Scheduler)
# Implements: APP-ADR-003, APP-ADR-011
# Adjacent modules: EventStore (read types), Scheduler (publish events)
# Assembly: Tier 1 + Storage domain + cross-domain deep (Coordination interfaces)
#
# NEGATIVE SPECIFICATION (what this module must NOT do):
# - Must NOT directly access TUI rendering state (use event bus)
# - Must NOT bypass the reservation system for file writes
# - Must NOT assume event ordering beyond the guarantees in APP-INV-017
# - Must NOT implement its own serialization (use shared codec from APP-ADR-011)
```

The module header is consumed by:
1. **The assembly script** — to determine what context to include in the bundle
2. **The LLM implementer** — to understand scope boundaries before reading
3. **The RALPH loop** — to determine module dependencies for improvement ordering

### 0.13.6 Cross-Module Reference Rules

**Rule 1: Cross-module references go through the constitution, never direct.** (Enforced by INV-012, locked by ADR-007.)

```
BAD:  "See section 7.3 in the Scheduler chapter for the dispatch algorithm"
GOOD: "This subsystem publishes SchedulerReady events (see APP-INV-032,
       maintained by the Scheduler module)"
```

The invariant lives in the constitution. Both modules can reference it without needing each other's content. The LLM implementing Module A never sees Module B's internals — only the contract (invariant) that Module B must satisfy.

**Rule 2: Shared types are defined in the constitution, not in any module.**

If two modules both use `TaskId` or `EventPayload`, the type definition lives in the domain constitution (Tier 2) or the system constitution (Tier 1), not in either module. Modules reference the type; they don't define it.

**Rule 3: The end-to-end trace is a special module.**

The end-to-end trace (§5.3) is the one element that legitimately crosses all module boundaries. It is stored as its own module file with a special header:

```yaml
# Module Header: End-to-End Trace
# Domain: cross-cutting
# Maintains: (none -- this module validates, it doesn't implement)
# Interfaces: ALL application invariants
# Purpose: Integration validation, not implementation
# Assembly: Tier 1 + ALL domain constitutions (no Tier 3 needed)
#
# BUDGET NOTE: With 3 domains at ~400 lines each + ~350 lines Tier 1,
# constitutional overhead is ~1,550 lines. The trace itself must fit in
# ~3,450 lines (5,000 ceiling) or ~2,450 lines (4,000 target).
# Sufficient because the trace has NO implementation detail.
```

### 0.13.7 Modularization Decision Flowchart

```
Is spec > 4,000 lines?
  |-- No  -> Is spec > 2,500 lines AND target context < 8K lines?
  |           |-- No  -> MONOLITH (no modularization needed, stop here)
  |           +-- Yes -> MODULE (recommended)
  +-- Yes -> MODULE (required)
             |
             How many invariants + ADRs total?
             |-- < 20 total AND system constitution fits in <= 400 lines
             |    -> TWO-TIER (see §0.13.7.1)
             +-- >= 20 total OR system constitution > 400 lines
                  -> Does system have natural domain boundaries?
                     |-- Yes -> THREE-TIER (standard protocol)
                     +-- No  -> Refactor architecture to create domain
                                boundaries, then THREE-TIER
```

#### 0.13.7.1 Two-Tier Simplification

For small modular specs, the domain tier can be skipped. In two-tier mode:

- **Tier 1 (System Constitution)**: Contains BOTH declarations AND full definitions for all invariants and ADRs (since there are few enough to fit in <=400 lines).
- **Tier 2 (Domain Constitution)**: SKIPPED. Does not exist in the file layout.
- **Tier 3 (Cross-Domain Deep)**: SKIPPED. Not needed because all full definitions are already in Tier 1.
- **Module**: Unchanged.

Assembly in two-tier mode: `system_constitution + module -> bundle`.

The manifest uses `tier_mode: two-tier` to signal this to the assembly script. If the spec grows beyond the two-tier threshold, migrate to three-tier by extracting domain constitutions (see Migration Procedure §0.13.13).

### 0.13.10 Assembly Rules

The assembly script reads the manifest and produces one bundle per module.

**Three-tier assembly (tier_mode: three-tier):**

```
ASSEMBLE(module_name):
  module = manifest.modules[module_name]
  bundle = []

  # Tier 1: Always included
  bundle.append(read(manifest.constitution.system))

  # Tier 2: Domain constitution
  if module.domain == "cross-cutting":
    for domain in manifest.constitution.domains:
      bundle.append(read(domain.file))
  else:
    bundle.append(read(manifest.constitution.domains[module.domain].file))

  # Tier 3: Cross-domain deep context (only if file exists)
  if module.deep_context is not null:
    bundle.append(read(module.deep_context))

  # The module itself
  bundle.append(read(module.file))

  # Budget validation (INV-014)
  total_lines = sum(line_count(section) for section in bundle)
  if total_lines > manifest.context_budget.hard_ceiling_lines:
    ERROR("Bundle {module_name}: {total_lines} lines exceeds ceiling "
          "{hard_ceiling_lines}. INV-014 VIOLATED.")
  elif total_lines > manifest.context_budget.target_lines:
    WARN("Bundle {module_name}: {total_lines} lines exceeds target "
         "{target_lines}.")

  write(bundles/{module_name}_bundle.md, join(bundle))
```

**Two-tier assembly (tier_mode: two-tier):**

```
ASSEMBLE(module_name):
  module = manifest.modules[module_name]
  bundle = []

  # Tier 1 contains FULL definitions in two-tier mode
  bundle.append(read(manifest.constitution.system))
  # No Tier 2, no Tier 3
  bundle.append(read(module.file))

  validate_budget(bundle, module_name)
  write(bundles/{module_name}_bundle.md, join(bundle))
```

### 0.13.11 Consistency Validation

Nine mechanical checks. All implementable by a validation script.

**CHECK-1: Invariant ownership completeness**
```
forall inv in invariant_registry:
  (inv.owner = "system" and count(s in modules : inv in s.maintains) = 0)
  or (inv.owner != "system" and count(s in modules : inv in s.maintains) = 1)
```
Remediation: Assign unowned invariant or remove duplicate owner.

**CHECK-2: Interface consistency**
```
forall s in modules, forall inv in s.interfaces (where s.interfaces != "all"):
  (exists other in modules : inv in other.maintains and other != s)
  or invariant_registry[inv].owner = "system"
```
Remediation: Add invariant to appropriate maintains list or register as system-owned.

**CHECK-3: Adjacency symmetry**
```
forall a in modules, forall b in a.adjacent
  (where a.adjacent != "all" and b.adjacent != "all"):
    a.name in manifest.modules[b].adjacent
```
Remediation: Add missing adjacency entry.

**CHECK-4: Domain membership consistency**
```
forall s in modules (where s.domain != "cross-cutting"),
  forall inv in s.maintains:
    invariant_registry[inv].domain = s.domain
    or invariant_registry[inv].domain = "system"
```
Remediation: Move invariant to module's domain or move module to invariant's domain.

**CHECK-5: Budget compliance**
```
forall s in modules:
  line_count(ASSEMBLE(s)) <= context_budget.hard_ceiling_lines
```
Remediation: Reduce module size, move content to constitution, or split module. (Validates INV-014.)

**CHECK-6: No orphan invariants**
```
forall inv in invariant_registry:
  exists s in modules : inv in s.maintains or inv in s.interfaces
```
Remediation: Add invariant to a module's interfaces or remove from registry.

**CHECK-7: Cross-module reference isolation**
```
forall module_file in module_files:
  not contains(module_file, pattern matching direct module-to-module references)
```
Remediation: Replace direct references with constitutional references. (Validates INV-012.)

**CHECK-8: Deep context correctness (three-tier only)**
```
forall s in modules (where s.domain != "cross-cutting"):
  let xd = {inv in s.interfaces :
    invariant_registry[inv].domain != s.domain
    and invariant_registry[inv].domain != "system"}
  (count(xd) > 0 implies s.deep_context != null)
  and (count(xd) = 0 implies s.deep_context = null)
```
Remediation: Create missing deep context file or remove unnecessary one.

**CHECK-9: File existence**
```
forall path in manifest.all_referenced_paths: file_exists(path)
forall module_file in filesystem("modules/"): module_file in manifest.modules.*.file
```
Remediation: Create missing file or correct manifest path. Second clause catches module files that exist on disk but are missing from the manifest. (Validates INV-016.)

### 0.13.12 Cascade Protocol

When constitutional content changes, affected modules must be re-validated.

**Blast radius by change type:**

| Change                          | Blast Radius                     |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Invariant wording changed       | Modules maintaining or interfacing |
| ADR superseded                  | Modules implementing that ADR     |
| New invariant added             | Module assigned as owner          |
| Shared type changed             | Same-domain + cross-domain users |
| Non-negotiable changed          | ALL modules                       |
| Glossary term redefined         | All modules using that term       |

**Cascade workflow (with beads):**

```
1. Author changes APP-INV-017 in constitution/domains/storage.md
2. Run: ddis_validate.sh --check-cascade APP-INV-017
3. Script queries manifest for affected modules:
   - event_store (maintains APP-INV-017) -> MUST re-validate
   - snapshot_manager (interfaces APP-INV-017) -> SHOULD re-validate
   - scheduler (interfaces APP-INV-017 via deep) -> SHOULD re-validate
4. Script creates/reopens br issues for affected modules
   Label: cascade:APP-INV-017, priority by blast radius
5. bv --robot-plan shows improvement order
6. Re-run assembly, re-validate affected modules
```

**Cascade workflow (without beads -- manifest-only fallback):**

```
1-3. Same as above.
4. Script prints affected modules to stdout:
   MUST:   event_store
   SHOULD: snapshot_manager, scheduler
5. Re-run assembly, manually re-validate affected modules
```

Both paths use the same manifest query. Beads adds persistence and ordering; the manifest provides the data either way.

### 0.13.13 Monolith-to-Module Migration Procedure

**Step 1: Identify domains.**
Group PART II chapters into 2-5 domains based on architectural boundaries.

**Step 2: Extract system constitution.**
From monolith to `constitution/system.md`: preamble, PART 0 sections, all invariant DECLARATIONS, all ADR DECLARATIONS, glossary (1-line definitions), quality gates, non-negotiables, non-goals.

**Step 3: Extract domain constitutions.**
For each domain to `constitution/domains/{domain}.md`: domain formal model, full invariant definitions owned by domain, full ADR analysis decided in domain, cross-domain interface contracts, domain performance budgets.

**Step 4: Extract modules.**
For each PART II chapter to `modules/{subsystem}.md`: add module header (§0.13.5), include implementation content, convert cross-module direct references to constitutional references (hardest step — see INV-012).

**Step 5: Create cross-domain deep context files.**
For each module interfacing with other-domain invariants: create `deep/{module}.md` with full definitions for cross-domain invariants, interface contracts, shared types.

**Step 6: Build manifest.**
Create `manifest.yaml` with all module entries, invariant registry, context budget.

**Step 7: Validate.**
Run `ddis_validate.sh` — all nine checks must pass.

**Step 8: Extract end-to-end trace.**
Create `modules/end_to_end_trace.md` as cross-cutting module. Verify bundle fits within budget.

**Step 9: LLM validation.**
Give 2+ bundles to an LLM. Zero questions requiring other module's implementation.

## Modularization Quality Gates (Full Detail)

These gates supplement Gates 1-7 for modular specs. A failing Gate M-1 makes Gates M-2 through M-5 irrelevant.

**Gate M-1: Consistency Checks**
All nine mechanical checks (CHECK-1 through CHECK-9 in §0.13.11) pass with zero errors. (Validates INV-012, INV-013, INV-014, INV-016.)

**Gate M-2: Bundle Budget Compliance**
Every assembled bundle is under the hard ceiling. Fewer than 20% of bundles exceed the target line count. (Validates INV-014.)

**Gate M-3: LLM Bundle Sufficiency**
An LLM receiving one assembled bundle produces zero questions that require another module's implementation content. Tested on at least 2 representative modules. (Validates INV-011.)

**Gate M-4: Declaration-Definition Faithfulness**
Every Tier 1 invariant declaration is a faithful summary of its Tier 2 full definition. (Validates INV-015.)

**Gate M-5: Cascade Simulation**
A simulated change to one invariant correctly identifies all affected modules via the cascade protocol (§0.13.12). (Validates INV-016 and the manifest's invariant registry.)
